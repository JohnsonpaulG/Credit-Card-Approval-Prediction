# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction

An intelligent Machine Learning based web application that predicts whether a credit card application is likely to be **Approved** or **Rejected** using applicant information. The project combines data preprocessing, machine learning, and a modern Flask web interface to simulate a real-world credit approval system.

# 📖 Project Overview

CredAI is an end-to-end Machine Learning project developed to automate the credit card approval process. The application analyzes applicant details and predicts whether the application should be approved or rejected using a trained Logistic Regression model.

The system provides a professional banking-style interface with prediction history, confidence scores, model information, and a responsive user experience.
